/**
 * Renders a tab NOBODY has open, off-screen, so its heights can be measured.
 *
 * `aura_rendered` is the only tool that can say what a widget really measures —
 * and it was the only one that could not answer for a tab that had just been
 * built, which is exactly when the question matters. A hidden tab is
 * `display: none` and measures zero, so the MCP server's answer was "ask the
 * user to open it": a human step in the middle of a check the model was doing on
 * its own. Reported from a session that had to open the tab through the public
 * URL in a browser to get any measurement at all.
 *
 * This closes it: the adapter writes a tab id into `info.renderProbe`, every
 * live frontend sees it, ONE of them renders that tab into a container parked
 * off-screen at the real grid width, and the report goes back the usual way
 * (Dashboard's own render-report effect does the measuring — the probe only
 * mounts it, so measurement and reality cannot drift apart).
 *
 * Off-screen rather than `display: none` or `visibility: hidden`: the box has to
 * be laid out for its content to have a height at all. `left: -20000px` keeps it
 * out of sight while every widget inside is a normally laid-out element.
 *
 * What the probe deliberately does NOT render: a camera and an iframe (see
 * `useIsProbe`). Mounting a camera would start a stream and — with a wake-up
 * datapoint — put the camera to SLEEP again on unmount, i.e. a probe would write
 * to a device somebody else is watching. Both types fill whatever box they get,
 * so their height is the box and nothing is lost by leaving them out.
