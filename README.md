## Installation

### Step 1 – Install adapter

Install Aura via ioBroker Admin:

1. Open ioBroker Admin
2. Go to **Adapters**
3. Search for **Aura** and install it

### Step 2 – Create instance

After installation, create a new **Aura** instance (if not done automatically).

### Step 3 – Configure web adapter

Open ioBroker Admin → Instances → **web.0** → Settings and set:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **socket.io** | **integrated** |

> **Important:** The default value "socket.io" uses the separate `iobroker.socketio` adapter on port 8084.
> Aura requires socket.io on the **same port** as the web adapter (integrated mode) so that both
> plain HTTP access and HTTPS via reverse proxy work with a single connection endpoint.

### Step 4 – Open dashboard

The dashboard is available at:

```
http://<iobroker-ip>:8082/aura/
```

The admin interface at:

```
http://<iobroker-ip>:8082/aura/#/admin
```

---

## HTTPS / Reverse Proxy

Aura works behind a reverse proxy (e.g. **nginx**, **Nginx Proxy Manager**, **Caddy**) with a
valid TLS certificate (e.g. Let's Encrypt). The web adapter socket.io must be set to **integrated**
(see Step 3) so that `/socket.io/` and `/aura/` are served from the same port.

### Nginx Proxy Manager – example configuration

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Forward Scheme | `http` |
| Forward Hostname / IP | `<iobroker-ip>` |
| Forward Port | `8082` |
| Websockets Support | enabled |

No additional custom nginx directives are needed when socket.io is set to **integrated**.

### Why not use the ioBroker web adapter's built-in HTTPS?

When the web adapter itself terminates TLS (self-signed certificate), browsers block programmatic
WebSocket connections (`wss://`) from JavaScript even after the user accepted the HTTPS warning in
the browser. A reverse proxy with a CA-signed certificate (e.g. Let's Encrypt) avoids this
restriction entirely.

## Widget Notes

### Camera widget

#### Stream URL types

The camera widget auto-detects the stream type based on the URL:

| URL pattern | Rendering | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `*.html` / `*.htm` | `<iframe>` | Works with go2rtc `stream.html`, any HTML-based player |
| `rtsp://` / `rtsps://` | Hint message | RTSP is not supported natively in browsers – use go2rtc as a proxy and enter the MJPEG URL instead |
| everything else | `<img>` | MJPEG (refresh interval = 0) or periodic snapshot |

**go2rtc MJPEG URL:** `http://<host>:1984/api/stream.mjpeg?src=<stream-name>`

#### Mixed Content (HTTP stream in HTTPS dashboard)

If Aura is served over **HTTPS** and the camera URL is **HTTP**, browsers apply mixed content rules:

| Client | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Desktop Chrome / Firefox | Usually allows passive content (`<img>` MJPEG), may block `<iframe>` |
| Chrome on Android | Allows passive mixed content |
| **Android WebView** (Fully Kiosk, custom apps) | **Blocks all mixed content by default** |
| Safari / iOS | Blocks active mixed content (`<iframe>`) |

**Fixes:**
- **Fully Kiosk Browser:** Settings → Advanced Web Settings → **Allow Mixed Content** ✓
- **Clean solution:** serve go2rtc behind a reverse proxy with HTTPS so the camera URL is also `https://`
- **Quick workaround:** open Aura via `http://` instead of `https://` in the kiosk browser (only if your network is trusted)

The widget config panel shows a warning automatically when a `http://` stream URL is detected while Aura is running on `https://`.

#### Wake-up datapoint (battery cameras, e.g. Eufy)

Some cameras (e.g. Eufy) need an explicit activation signal before the stream is available. Configure an ioBroker datapoint in the widget settings – the widget sends `true` when the stream should start and `false` when it stops.

Three trigger modes are available:

| Mode | When is `true` sent? |
|---|---|
| Automatisch | On page load |
| Bei Sicht | When the widget scrolls into the viewport |
| Bei Klick | When the user taps the widget placeholder |

## Changelog

### 0.5.4 (2026-04-25)
