## Installation

### Step 1 – Install adapter

Install Aura via ioBroker Admin:

1. Open ioBroker Admin
2. Go to **Adapters**
3. Search for **Aura** and install it

### Step 2 – Create instance

After installation, create a new **Aura** instance (if not done automatically).

### Step 3 – Configure web adapter

Open ioBroker Admin → Instances → **web.0** → Settings and set:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **socket.io** | **integrated** |

> **Important:** The default value "socket.io" uses the separate `iobroker.socketio` adapter on port 8084.
> Aura requires socket.io on the **same port** as the web adapter (integrated mode) so that both
> plain HTTP access and HTTPS via reverse proxy work with a single connection endpoint.

### Step 4 – Open dashboard

The dashboard is available at:

```
http://<iobroker-ip>:8082/aura/
```

The admin interface at:

```
http://<iobroker-ip>:8082/aura/#/admin
```

---

## HTTPS / Reverse Proxy

Aura works behind a reverse proxy (e.g. **nginx**, **Nginx Proxy Manager**, **Caddy**) with a
valid TLS certificate (e.g. Let's Encrypt). The web adapter socket.io must be set to **integrated**
(see Step 3) so that `/socket.io/` and `/aura/` are served from the same port.

### Nginx Proxy Manager – example configuration

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Forward Scheme | `http` |
| Forward Hostname / IP | `<iobroker-ip>` |
| Forward Port | `8082` |
| Websockets Support | enabled |

No additional custom nginx directives are needed when socket.io is set to **integrated**.

### Why not use the ioBroker web adapter's built-in HTTPS?

When the web adapter itself terminates TLS (self-signed certificate), browsers block programmatic
WebSocket connections (`wss://`) from JavaScript even after the user accepted the HTTPS warning in
the browser. A reverse proxy with a CA-signed certificate (e.g. Let's Encrypt) avoids this
restriction entirely.
