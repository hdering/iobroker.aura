# ioBroker.aura

**Aura** is a modern visualization dashboard for [ioBroker](https://www.iobroker.net/).

📖 **[Documentation](https://hdering.github.io/ioBroker.aura/)** – widgets, settings, screenshots

---

## Installation

### Step 1 – Install adapter

Install Aura via ioBroker Admin:

1. Open ioBroker Admin
2. Go to **Adapters**
3. Search for **Aura** and install it

### Step 2 – Create instance

After installation, create a new **Aura** instance (if not done automatically).

### Step 3 – Configure the instance

Aura runs its **own web server** (frontend + built-in iframe proxy) and connects to an existing
`iobroker.web` instance only for the socket.io data connection. Open the **Aura** instance settings:

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Port** | `8095` | Port of Aura's HTTP server (frontend + iframe proxy) |
| **ioBroker socket port** | `8082` | Port of the `iobroker.web` instance that provides the socket.io connection |
| **Web adapter uses HTTPS** | off | Enable if that web instance runs HTTPS |

> **Requirement:** A running `iobroker.web` (or `iobroker.socketio`) instance must serve socket.io on
> the configured socket port. The stock `web.0` with **socket.io = integrated** provides this on
> port `8082` (the default). Aura auto-detects the matching instance and proxies the connection
> internally, so no `/aura/` path or web extension is needed anymore.

### Step 4 – Open dashboard

The dashboard is available at:

```
http://<iobroker-ip>:8095/
```

The admin interface at:

```
http://<iobroker-ip>:8095/#/admin
```

---

## HTTPS / Reverse Proxy

Aura can serve HTTPS in two ways.

### Option A – Built-in TLS

Enable **Use HTTPS** in the Aura instance settings and select the certificates (loaded from ioBroker
`system.certificates`). Aura's own server then serves `https://<iobroker-ip>:8095/`.

> The default self-signed certificate triggers a browser warning. For a clean setup use proper
> certificates (e.g. Let's Encrypt) or put Aura behind a reverse proxy (Option B).

### Option B – Reverse proxy

Point a reverse proxy (e.g. **nginx**, **Nginx Proxy Manager**, **Caddy**) with a valid TLS
certificate at Aura's port. Aura proxies the socket.io connection to the web instance internally, so
a single forwarded port is enough.

#### Nginx Proxy Manager – example configuration

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Forward Scheme | `http` |
| Forward Hostname / IP | `<iobroker-ip>` |
| Forward Port | `8095` |
| Websockets Support | enabled |

> **Alternative topology:** If you instead proxy `/socket.io/` and `/echarts/` directly to the web
> adapter port, set **ioBroker socket URL (override)** in the Aura settings to your public URL
> (e.g. `https://your-domain.com`) so the frontend connects socket.io to the right endpoint.

## Versioning

Aura uses a simple scheme so you can tell stable releases from test builds at a glance:

| Version | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `0.10.2-next1`, `0.10.2-next2`, … | **Test builds** for the upcoming `0.10.2` release. Pre-releases, published for testing only. |
| `0.10.1` in the **Latest** repo | A published release in ioBroker's *Latest* repository. Available to everyone, but still on probation — not yet promoted to *Stable*. |
| `0.10.1` in the **Stable** repo | The same version after it has proven itself error-free in the field. This is the truly stable build. |

- A **`-nextN` suffix** marks a pre-release. The number counts the test builds leading up to the next plain version (`next1`, `next2`, …). Pre-releases are **not** offered automatically in ioBroker; you only get them if you explicitly install that version.
- A **plain number** (`0.10.1`, `0.10.2`, …) is first published to ioBroker's **Latest** repository. This makes it generally available, but *Latest* is the proving ground — one step before truly stable.
- Once a *Latest* release has run long enough with no errors reported, the **same version** is promoted to the **Stable** repository. Only then is it considered fully stable.

So the path of any release is: `-nextN` test build → **Latest** (published, on probation) → **Stable** (promoted once confirmed error-free).

## Changelog

_Older releases: see [CHANGELOG_OLD.md](CHANGELOG_OLD.md)._

### 0.55.1 (2026-09-07)
- 🌟 **New feature:** Popups - the inner padding is now adjustable (globally, per popup view, per click action), and the scrollbar lane is only reserved while the popup really scrolls, so list rows in a popup get the full width ([#621](https://github.com/hdering/ioBroker.aura/issues/621))


### 0.55.0 (2026-09-06)
- 🌟 **New feature:** Universal Widget - the select cell can now take its entries from a JSON datapoint, and shows icons, images and HTML inside the dropdown, just like the standalone select widget ([#615](https://github.com/hdering/ioBroker.aura/issues/615))
- MCP server - aura_rendered now lists every widget of the tab, including the ones that draw nothing, and prints the content height next to the rendered one; a card that is simply larger than it needs to be is no longer reported as a deviation
- 🌟 **New feature:** Calendar - the calendar name, the event title, the date, the location and the coloured marker each carry their own CSS class now; the coloured dot/bar can be switched off, the calendar name aligned and the calendar icon resized in the editor ([#618](https://github.com/hdering/ioBroker.aura/issues/618))
- 🌟 **New feature:** General - Aura now points out a newer adapter version: the admin sidebar shows it next to the version number, and an optional instance setting announces it in the frontend as a message ([#617](https://github.com/hdering/ioBroker.aura/issues/617))
- 🌟 **New feature:** Dynamic list - a row can be given its own icon size even when the icon itself comes from the list-wide setting; the entry's icon button now shows that inherited icon faintly ([#616](https://github.com/hdering/ioBroker.aura/issues/616))
- Settings - a device keeps its client ID: it is stored in the browser instead of being derived from the browser version, so a browser update no longer turns a named device into a new, nameless duplicate. A fixed, speaking ID can now be assigned per device, either in Connected Devices or by opening Aura with ?client=living-room-tablet ([#620](https://github.com/hdering/ioBroker.aura/issues/620))
- 🌟 **New feature:** General - condition rules can be reordered afterwards: drag the new grip in the rule header or use the up/down arrows. Works everywhere rules are edited - widget and tab conditions, the list-wide and per-entry rules of the static and dynamic list, the datapoints of a second line, and the cells of the universal widget ([#623](https://github.com/hdering/ioBroker.aura/issues/623))


### 0.54.2 (2026-09-05)
- Fill - dragging an adjustable limit no longer triggers the click action of the surrounding group ([#619](https://github.com/hdering/ioBroker.aura/issues/619))
- AI access (MCP) - the dashboard now reports the heights it really renders; aura_rendered shows what scrolls and where the estimate is off
- AI access (MCP) - aura_update_widgets changes several widgets in one validated write, so rearranging a column no longer fails on intermediate overlaps
- AI access (MCP) - aura_measure says how each widget type reacts to height, and aura_dashboard says on which row every tab ends
- AI access (MCP) - tab paths and popup names are accepted exactly as the error messages print them
- AI access (MCP) - new multiroom recipe, and an option a widget only reads on another layout is now reported instead of silently ignored


### 0.54.1 (2026-09-05)
- List - the icon size of a row can be set for every display type again, and an icon switch now has a size of its own ([#616](https://github.com/hdering/ioBroker.aura/issues/616))


### 0.54.0 (2026-09-05)
- Mediaplayer - a stop datapoint now works: a stop button appears next to play/pause when one is configured
- Mediaplayer - players found by device detection (Alexa, Sonos, Spotify, Kodi) can be edited through AI access again; their next/previous/shuffle/repeat datapoints were declared as switches and every write was refused
- AI access - widgets can be edited far more reliably: a leftover option no longer blocks every change, a position can be changed one value at a time, every write is read back and reported honestly, the new tool aura_compact clears editor-only overlaps, and height measurement now uses real content (charts, chips, media players, energy balances, carousels) with a row factor measured per list layout
- 🌟 **New feature:** Fill level - adjustable limits: any number of lines on the scale, each from its own datapoint, draggable in the dashboard and written straight back - charge ceiling, discharge floor, priority thresholds ([#613](https://github.com/hdering/ioBroker.aura/issues/613))
- 🌟 **New feature:** Fill level - the sections between two limits carry their own colour and their own icon, and the fill can switch colour as soon as a limit is reached ([#613](https://github.com/hdering/ioBroker.aura/issues/613))
- 🌟 **New feature:** Fill level - new "Balken" layout: a flat bar with rounded ends for a limit that is not a tank ([#613](https://github.com/hdering/ioBroker.aura/issues/613))


### 0.53.5 (2026-09-04)
- AI access (MCP) - below the delete permission, a write that leaves existing widgets out is now refused instead of removing them ([#614](https://github.com/hdering/ioBroker.aura/issues/614))


### 0.53.4 (2026-09-04)
- 🌟 **New feature:** Popups - the background colour can now be set globally, per popup view and per click action; new theme tokens `--popup-bg` / `--popup-border` colour every popup of a layout ([#611](https://github.com/hdering/ioBroker.aura/issues/611))
- AI (MCP) - aura_measure now computes heights for the dashboard's own font scale and widget padding instead of the default ones, and counts a section separator with a heading as the taller row it is; list heights used to come out too small from about four rows on
- Overview - new card explaining that Aura can now be controlled by an AI assistant over MCP, with the setup steps and a link to the documentation; it now sits above the health cards instead of below them, and once MCP is switched on it shrinks to a status line naming the level the assistant runs at, unfoldable back into the full guide
- Overview - the orphaned-datapoint and broken-reference lists show five entries each and move the rest into a "show all" dialog, so a damaged installation no longer stretches the page and pushes everything below it out of sight
- General - the loading screen now reports an unreachable ioBroker server after 8 seconds instead of spinning forever without explanation, and offers a reload button
- AI (MCP) - the endpoint can now be reached through `mcp-remote`, which is what Claude Desktop needs: OAuth discovery probes are answered with a plain 404 instead of the dashboard page, so the bridge no longer dies with `Unexpected token '<'`; a wrong token now reports itself as one instead of failing somewhere inside an OAuth flow, and browser-hosted clients get the CORS preflight they need ([#612](https://github.com/hdering/ioBroker.aura/issues/612))
- Settings - the MCP section now offers two ready-made client blocks side by side: the short HTTP one for Claude Code, and one that runs the same server through mcp-remote for Claude Desktop, which cannot speak HTTP itself ([#612](https://github.com/hdering/ioBroker.aura/issues/612))


### 0.53.3 (2026-09-03)
- MCP server - aura_measure counts the last-change line under a list row (+13.7 px): per affected row for the static list, for every row where the dynamic list switches it on list-wide
- MCP server - the widget schema no longer advertises 45 options a widget never reads: the option reader followed an import into another widget and attributed its options to the wrong type (the static list alone carried 25 of them, among them maxRows, entryDisplay and groupByRoom — all measured as ineffective)


### 0.53.2 (2026-09-03)
- Extended chart - the whole chart follows the theme now: series colours, axis labels, axis and grid lines, the legend and the gauge track. A var(--token) is resolved before it reaches the canvas, so the same colour rule holds for charts as for every other widget (a token the theme does not define is reported by aura_validate). Light themes gain the most — the grid lines were a near-black fixed grey
- Documentation - step-by-step guide for connecting the AI assistant (MCP): enabling the endpoint, generating the token, pasting the client block, and setting up the ioBroker MCP server it needs
- MCP server - aura_validate and aura_measure answer more accurately: aura_validate takes every payload shape the write tools take, a bare widget array included, and no longer reports a write on a read-only row (a state or contact display writes nothing, and a row with writable false is taken at its word); aura_measure charges the second line under a list entry only to the rows that have one (a list of twelve with four second lines was reported 123 px too big) and counts a separator as the shorter row it is


### 0.53.1 (2026-09-02)
- Editor - the "+ Tab" wizard button is gone; tabs are built with the MCP server or from single widgets
- Import dialog - the AI prompt generator is gone; the MCP server produces better widget JSON
- List - editing a list with two rows on the same datapoint no longer leaves stale rows behind
- MCP server - aura_measure sizes a list row by its display, so a list of window contacts is no longer reported as fitting while it scrolls
- MCP server - aura_validate warns about row settings the chosen display never reads (on/off labels on a value row, a state mapping without displayType "states")
- MCP server - the widget schema now spells out inline option shapes, so a contact row can be relabelled through contactAppearance (e.g. "heizt"/"zu" for a heating valve) instead of falling back to a state mapping


### 0.53.0 (2026-09-02)
- General - widget titles keep their descenders (g, p, y) when the font scale is above 100 %
- AI assistant (MCP) - now reads the editor guidelines as the target screen and builds tabs that fit it, instead of guessing the width from existing widgets
- AI assistant (MCP) - list heights are now measured per layout and per option (second line, header), and the answer names what the number leaves out
- AI assistant (MCP) - validation now warns when any control sits on a read-only datapoint: a switch row of a list, the up/stop/down of a shutter, the channels of a lamp - not just the widget datapoint
- AI assistant (MCP) - click actions are documented at last: every kind and its fields, an error for an invented one, and a plain note that no click action writes a datapoint (use chips, a list row, enum or httpRequest for that)
- AI assistant (MCP) - hands over the dashboard theme palette (new aura_theme tool, and the base tokens in aura_dashboard), so generated widgets use var(--accent-green) instead of a hard-coded hex that only fits one theme
- 🌟 **New feature:** Calendar - custom layout now reaches every visible event, not just the next one: each field takes an event number in the cell config, so a whole agenda can be built as one grid row per event ([#608](https://github.com/hdering/ioBroker.aura/issues/608))
- 🌟 **New feature:** Calendar - custom layout gains the end time, the time span (09:00 - 10:30) and a calendar week that only prints where the week changes; the calendar icon is now per event too ([#608](https://github.com/hdering/ioBroker.aura/issues/608))
- Dynamic list and status overview - new "maximum rows" setting: the widget now fits a planned height and shows the rest as a "+N more" line instead of cutting rows off silently
- AI assistant (MCP) - new recipe for one row rule covering a whole list (rowConditions with {{parent}}), and the recipes now use theme colour tokens instead of fixed hex values
- 🌟 **New feature:** Calendar - new "show end time" option: the date of a timed appointment now reads 09:00 - 10:30 in every layout ([#608](https://github.com/hdering/ioBroker.aura/issues/608))
- Calendar - new "always show calendar name" option: the default layout can now name its source even when only one calendar is configured ([#608](https://github.com/hdering/ioBroker.aura/issues/608))
- Editor - the "New widget" dialog is one step now: pick a datapoint or a type and it is added right away; a double click on a tile adds it directly, title, unit and layout stay in the widget editor
- Markers - a marker with a long label no longer disappears under the widget next to it: it hangs over the edge by a few px only, is clamped to its own card with an ellipsis, and is painted above its neighbours


### 0.52.9 (2026-09-02)
- MCP - aura_review no longer suggests folding a KPI row into a list: tiles with their own thresholds, conditions or badges are left out of the tile-row finding
- Custom layout - a matching cell condition now colors the bar of a progress or bar-style slider cell, not just the text on it
- 🌟 **New feature:** Markers - the label text of a widget, section or tab marker now shows datapoint values, e.g. "{0_userdata.0.Pool.MaxRun} min", including operation chains and expressions like free HTML


### 0.52.8 (2026-09-02)
- MCP - the history check now also runs while writing: aura_write_tab, aura_add_widget and aura_update_widget report a chart series on an unrecorded datapoint instead of writing it silently
- MCP - aura_measure no longer reads like a finding when a widget type has no measured height; the reason now says why there is no number instead of demanding a change


### 0.52.7 (2026-09-02)
- MCP - aura_validate and aura_review now report a chart series whose datapoint no history adapter records, plus a typo in a series datapoint
- MCP - aura_review takes a scope (one tab or the whole dashboard) and no longer reports element ids as missing datapoints or a power reading as a meter
- MCP - energy balance entries are checked for history too, a datapoint logged to an uninstalled instance is reported, and aura_dashboard names the available history adapters
- MCP - conditions.elements is now described in the schema (icon/title/value with their fields) instead of being an untyped object


### 0.52.6 (2026-09-01)
- MCP - aura_measure sizes widgets against measured heights, aura_review checks existing tabs for dead datapoints and ineffective options, aura_types fetches shared types once


### 0.52.5 (2026-09-01)
- Chart (advanced) - in "manage datapoints" the mode is picked on its description card (the duplicate button row is gone), and the JSON mode is now called "Categories (JSON)" to tell it apart from a time series with a JSON data source
- Chart (advanced) - a JSON series whose labels are no timestamps no longer fails silently in a time series: the empty chart and the series editor both name the reason, and the editor offers to switch to "Categories (JSON)"


### 0.52.4 (2026-09-01)
- Chart (advanced) - a JSON series now shows the accepted JSON shapes right under its datapoint, unfolded until the payload could be read


### 0.52.3 (2026-09-01)
- Settings - MCP fields are only shown when MCP is enabled, and the token is no longer displayed in clear text ([#610](https://github.com/hdering/ioBroker.aura/issues/610))
- Settings - the MCP token is now stored encrypted; a hand-typed token has to be entered once more after this update ([#610](https://github.com/hdering/ioBroker.aura/issues/610))


### 0.52.2 (2026-09-01)
- 🌟 **New feature:** Calendar - each calendar source can carry its own icon, shown in front of its entries ([#608](https://github.com/hdering/ioBroker.aura/issues/608))
- 🌟 **New feature:** Calendar - optional calendar week, printed at the first entry of every week ([#608](https://github.com/hdering/ioBroker.aura/issues/608))
- 🌟 **New feature:** Calendar - multi-day events can be shown as one entry per day ([#608](https://github.com/hdering/ioBroker.aura/issues/608))


### 0.52.1 (2026-09-01)
- AI assistant (MCP, beta) - two new tools aimed at the same thing: dashboards that use what AURA can do. aura_recipes hands the model finished, valid widgets for the jobs that come up - a room as one list instead of a row of value tiles, a counter as consumption bars, a tile with colour thresholds and conditions, a status overview, a thermostat dial, a whole room tab. aura_review goes the other way and looks over a tab that already exists, naming what would make it better: tile rows that belong in one list, numbers with no good or bad range, a meter shown as its raw reading, a bar chart without an aggregation, a list with no second line - each finding names the widgets and the recipe that fixes it, and stays a suggestion. On top of that the instructions now send the model to a recipe and to an existing tab of the dashboard before it reads the schema, so a generated view no longer comes back as the bare minimum the schema accepts
- Editor - the "AI prompt" dialog now pastes worked examples into the prompt (the same ones the MCP server hands out) and says what a good dashboard looks like, instead of only what is valid JSON. The old wording asked the model to leave options out, which is why generated views came back as bare tiles
