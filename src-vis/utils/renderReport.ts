/**
 * What the widgets of the open tab ACTUALLY measure in the browser.
 *
 * The MCP server can read the configuration and it can compute a height from
 * measured per-type metrics — but it cannot look at the result. Reported from a
 * session that laid out 28 lists: every number that turned out right came from
 * reading the real DOM through the browser, not from the server. The static
 * metrics table also ages with every CSS commit, and nothing says so.
 *
 * This closes that gap the cheap way: the frontend already knows its own layout,
 * so once a tab has settled it sends the rendered height, the content height and
 * whether anything scrolls to the adapter (sendTo 'renderReport', the same route
 * the load-time metrics take). `aura_rendered` reads it back and compares it with
 * the estimate — so „braucht 52 px“ and „rendert 66 px und scrollt“ can finally
 * be told apart.
 *
 * Only the ACTIVE tab is reported: a hidden tab is `display: none` and measures
 * zero. That is a limit, not a defect — the answer names the tab and the age of
 * the measurement, and a tab nobody has opened simply has none.
