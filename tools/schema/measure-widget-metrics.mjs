 * Measures how much height a widget's content actually needs.

 *   node tools/schema/measure-widget-metrics.mjs            (dev server on 5174)
 *   AURA_BASE=http://localhost:5174 node tools/schema/measure-widget-metrics.mjs
 *   … --only list,value    measure a few types while working on the table
 *   … --only list --write  measure those types and MERGE them into the committed
 *                          JSON — everything else keeps its numbers. A full run
 *                          takes the best part of an hour, so re-measuring 29
 *                          types to change one is not the way to fix one type.
 *   … --check              fail when the committed JSON is stale
 *
 * Output: public/ai/aura-widget-metrics.json, served to a model by aura_measure.
 *
 * Why measure rather than estimate: sizing a widget is the one thing a model
 * cannot check for itself. It writes gridPos.h in rows, the browser renders px,
 * and the result — a list cut off after nine of sixteen rows, a gauge squeezed
 * into an ellipse — is invisible in the JSON. Doing the arithmetic by hand
 * ("h*20 + (h-1)*8 — do sixteen rows fit in h=14?") is exactly what goes wrong.
 *
 * How: the real app renders the widget through the __auraShot harness on a grid
 * with 2 px rows (and normal 20 px columns, so the width stays realistic), and
 * the height is walked down until the content no longer fits. "Fits" means two
 * things at once — nothing scrolls inside the widget, and nothing is drawn
 * outside its card. The second is what catches the tiles: they do not scroll,
 * they simply spill over the edge.
 *
 * The walk goes DOWNWARD from a height that fits, never as a binary search: a
 * chart at 30 px renders no axis at all and would report "fits", and a search
 * would happily return that.
 *
 * Everything runs against injected demo state with screenshotMode on, so no
 * ioBroker state is ever written. The frontend does not need a reachable ioBroker
 * to render — it boots "Getrennt" and the harness feeds it — but index.html loads
 * /socket.io/socket.io.js as a blocking script, so a dev proxy whose target hangs
 * (unreachable host, not a refused port) never lets the page start at all.
 *
 * Everything is measured TWICE, at font scale 1 and at 1.3, because a measured
 * height is only a fact for the presentation it was measured in. Reported from a
 * running dashboard: with `fontScale` 1.3 and `widgetPadding` 8 every list came
 * out wrong — 14 px too much chrome and 4.8 px too little per row, which cancel
 * at three rows and diverge in both directions from there. The padding is exact
 * arithmetic (it sits twice in the chrome, so aura_measure corrects it without a
 * second measurement); the font scale is not, so it is measured.
 *
 * The second point also says WHICH KIND of row a display draws. A contact chip is
 * a text line: its +4 px stays +4 px at every scale. A shutter row is a control of
 * a fixed 43 px: its +10 px at scale 1 shrinks as the text grows and is gone once
 * the text is taller. `addPx` and `fontScalePx` carry that difference.
 *
 * A full run takes its time (every point walks down from 800 px, the list is
 * measured per layout AND per row display, and all of it twice) — half an hour is
 * normal. Use `--only list` while working on one type.
