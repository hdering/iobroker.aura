/**
 * PIN protection for sections ("Bereiche") and tabs.
 *
 * A section or tab may carry a `pin`. As long as it is not unlocked, the frontend
 * refuses to render its content and shows the PIN prompt instead — no matter
 * whether the viewer clicked the entry in the menu / tab bar or opened its slug
 * URL directly.
 *
 * The gate is deliberately advisory: everything the frontend knows lives in the
 * browser, so a PIN keeps guests and children out of a tab, it is not a secret
 * store. Keep that in mind before putting anything behind it that must not be
 * read at all.
 *
 * Pure module (no React, no store imports) so tools/tests/pin-lock.mjs can bundle
 * and drive it directly.
